# HTML-CSS-Project

The following project is meant to help me learn HTML by following the video made by Web Dev Simplified on FreeCodeCamp! The link to the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMT54MPz9oE!

The project involves writing a website for a musician using HTML and CSS which in my case, I wrote for my favourite singer Jay Chou.

There are 3 pages written for the website:

- Home
- About
- Favourite

The website can be accessed at https://davidtaapy.github.io/David-Learns-HTML/ but not all buttons are fully functional at the moment!
