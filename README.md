# HTML-CSS-Project

The following project is meant to help me learn HTML by following the video made by Web Dev Simplified on FreeCodeCamp! The link to the video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMT54MPz9oE!

The project involves writing a website for a musician using HTML and CSS which in my case, I wrote for my favourite singer Jay Chou.

There are 3 pages written for the website:
- Home
- About
- Favourite
